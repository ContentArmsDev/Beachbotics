            <h2>FIRST LEGO League Competition</h2>
            <p>The FIRST LEGO League (FLL) is an international robotics competition that encourages children and teenagers to think like scientists and engineers. Each year, FLL releases a new challenge based on a real-world scientific topic. Teams must design, build, and program a robot using LEGO Mindstorms technology to complete tasks and score points on a themed playing field.</p>
            <p>This year's challenge is all about renewable energy solutions, and we are excited to showcase our innovative projects and robotic solutions at the upcoming regional competition!</p>
